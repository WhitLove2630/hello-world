# hello-world
first repository
this is my first time on GitHub and i'm just learning how it all works, it looks pretty cool and like it will solve a problem I have been having in my coding. I will go in to a version of code, and try to work through bugs or add a feature, and will in turn break more parts of code or forget when I made edits and to what version, so we will see if the branches feature of this service will help me keep track of stupid bullshit like that.
